    We can detone the \textit{depth} of a node $u$ as the distance $d(u,c)$ from the central node $c$. Since each node has a unique depth, we can split the vertex set $V$ into a partition of subsets $V_i \subseteq V$ with $0 \leq i \leq P$ such that:
    \[
        V_i = \left\{v \in V \mid \text{$v$ has depth $i$}\right\}
    \]

    For a layer $V_j$, each node has $k$ neighbors, one of which is the parent on $V_{j-1}$. Therefore,
