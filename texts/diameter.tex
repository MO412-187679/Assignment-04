\section{Diameter}

    Considering the central node $c$ of $T(k,P)$, we could denote each of the $k$ subtrees from $T(k,P) - c$ as the \textit{branches} of the Cayley tree. We can clearly see that the largest path on this tree must be from two leaves $u$ and $v$ on distinct branches. Since they are disconnected only in $T(k,P) - c$, we have $d(u,v) = d(u,c) + d(c,v) = P + P$. Therefore, $d_{\max} = 2 P$.
